# Job Broadcasting System - Testing & Debugging Guide

This guide helps you test and debug the job broadcasting system to ensure it's working correctly.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Check Redis Installation

First, ensure Redis is installed and running:

**Windows:**

```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
# Install Redis if not installed
sudo apt-get install redis-server  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install redis                 # Mac

# Start Redis
sudo systemctl start redis-server  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew services start redis          # Mac

# Test connection
redis-cli ping
```

### 2. Test Redis Connection

```bash
cd Backend
node test-redis.js
```

Expected output:

```
üß™ Testing Redis connection...
‚úÖ Redis connection successful
‚úÖ Redis publish successful
‚úÖ Redis subscribe successful
üì® Received message: {"hello":"world"}
‚úÖ Redis test completed successfully
```

### 3. Test Database Schema

```bash
cd Backend
node test-db-schema.js
```

Expected output:

```
üß™ Testing database schema...
üìã Checking table existence...
‚úÖ Tables found: ['live_locations', 'specializations', 'workers']
üìã Checking live_locations columns...
‚úÖ live_locations columns:
   - created_at: timestamp without time zone
   - id: uuid
   - lat: double precision
   - lng: double precision
   - worker_id: uuid
üìã Checking specializations columns...
‚úÖ specializations columns:
   - category: character varying
   - created_at: timestamp without time zone
   - id: uuid
   - name: character varying
   - sub_category: character varying
   - worker_id: uuid
üìã Checking workers with locations...
‚úÖ Workers with locations: 5
üìã Testing worker search query...
‚úÖ Query successful! Found 3 workers
üéâ Database schema test completed successfully!
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
cd Backend
npm run dev
```

### 5. Monitor Console Output

Watch for these log patterns:

```
üöÄ [SERVER] Starting server initialization...
üîå [REDIS] Connecting to Redis...
‚úÖ [REDIS] Successfully connected to Redis
üîå [SOCKET] Initializing Socket.IO...
‚úÖ [SOCKET] Socket.IO initialized

## üîç Testing Worker Matching

### Test Nearby Workers Endpoint

curl "http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/nearby-workers?lat=12.9716&lng=77.5946&radius=10&category=plumber"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "workers": [
    {
      "worker_id": "uuid1",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
      "experienceYears": 5,
      "lat": 12.975,
      "lng": 77.59,
      "distance": 2.34
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "searchParams": {
    "lat": 12.9716,
    "lng": 77.5946,
    "radius": 10,
    "category": "plumber"
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Socket Events

### 1. Connect Worker Socket

```javascript
// Frontend or test client
const socket = io("http://localhost:5000");

// Join worker room
socket.emit("join_worker_room", { workerId: "your-worker-uuid" });

// Listen for job requests
socket.on("job_request", (jobData) => {
  console.log("Received job request:", jobData);
});

// Accept a job
socket.emit("accept_job", {
  jobId: "job-uuid",
  workerId: "your-worker-uuid",
});

// Listen for acceptance confirmation
socket.on("job_accepted_success", (data) => {
  console.log("Job accepted:", data);
});
```

### 2. Connect User Socket

```javascript
const socket = io("http://localhost:5000");

// Join user room
socket.emit("join_user_room", { userId: "your-user-uuid" });

// Listen for job status updates
socket.on("job_status", (status) => {
  console.log("Job status:", status);
});

socket.on("job_accepted", (data) => {
  console.log("Job accepted by worker:", data);
});
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Redis Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**

```
‚ùå [REDIS_PUBLISH] Failed to broadcast job: ClientClosedError: The client is closed
```

**Solutions:**

- **Check Redis installation:**
  ```bash
  redis-cli ping
  # Should return: PONG
  ```
- **Start Redis server:**

  ```bash
  # Windows
  redis-server

  # Linux
  sudo systemctl start redis-server

  # Mac
  brew services start redis
  ```

- **Test Redis connection:**
  ```bash
  node test-redis.js
  ```
- **Check Redis configuration:**
  - Verify Redis is running on default port 6379
  - Check if Redis requires authentication
  - Ensure firewall allows Redis connections

#### 2. No Workers Found

**Symptoms:**

```
‚ùå [WORKER_SEARCH] No workers found for job uuid-here
```

**Solutions:**

- Check if workers exist in database
- Verify worker locations in `live_locations` table
- Test with larger radius: `?radius=20`
- Remove category filter: `?lat=12.9716&lng=77.5946&radius=10`

#### 3. Socket Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**

```
‚ùå [SOCKET_EMIT] Failed to notify worker uuid: Socket not connected
```

**Solutions:**

- Verify Socket.IO server is running
- Check CORS settings
- Ensure workers are connected to correct rooms
- Test socket connection manually

#### 4. Database Query Issues

**Symptoms:**

```
‚ùå [WORKER_SEARCH] Database error in getNearbyWorkers
```

**Solutions:**

- Check database connection
- Verify table schemas
- Test SQL query manually
- Check for missing indexes

### Debug Commands

#### Check Redis Status

```bash
redis-cli ping
redis-cli info clients
redis-cli monitor  # Watch Redis commands in real-time
```

#### Check System Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/health
```

#### Check Database

```sql
-- Check workers with locations
SELECT w.id, w.firstName, w.lastName, ll.lat, ll.lng
FROM workers w
JOIN live_locations ll ON w.id = ll.workerId
LIMIT 5;

-- Check job status
SELECT id, status, workerId, createdAt
FROM jobs
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Monitor Socket Connections

```javascript
// In browser console or test client
console.log("Socket connected:", socket.connected);
console.log("Socket rooms:", socket.rooms);
```

## üìà Performance Testing

### Load Testing

```bash
# Test multiple job creations
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"userId\": \"user-$i\",
      \"description\": \"Test job $i\",
      \"location\": \"Test Location $i\",
      \"lat\": 12.9716,
      \"lng\": 77.5946,
      \"bookedFor\": \"2024-01-15T14:00:00Z\",
      \"durationMinutes\": 60
    }" &
done
wait
```

### Monitor Performance

```bash
# Check metrics after load test
curl http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/broadcast-metrics
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### Successful Flow

1. ‚úÖ Job created in database
2. ‚úÖ Job published to Redis
3. ‚úÖ Redis subscriber receives message
4. ‚úÖ Workers found within radius
5. ‚úÖ Workers sorted by distance/experience
6. ‚úÖ Socket.IO notifications sent
7. ‚úÖ User notified of success
8. ‚úÖ Metrics updated

### Error Handling

- ‚ùå Job creation fails ‚Üí Return error to user
- ‚ùå Redis publish fails ‚Üí Continue job creation
- ‚ùå No workers found ‚Üí Notify user
- ‚ùå Socket emit fails ‚Üí Log error, continue
- ‚ùå Database errors ‚Üí Return 500 error

## üìù Log Analysis

### Key Log Patterns to Monitor

```
‚úÖ [JOB_CREATION] - Job created successfully
‚úÖ [REDIS_PUBLISH] - Redis publish successful
‚úÖ [SOCKET_EMIT] - Worker notified successfully
‚ùå [REDIS_PUBLISH] - Redis publish failed
‚ùå [SOCKET_EMIT] - Socket emit failed
üìä [METRICS] - Performance metrics
```

### Performance Indicators

- **Success Rate**: Should be > 95%
- **Average Workers per Job**: 1-10 workers
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for job creation
- **Broadcast Time**: < 1 second for worker notification

This testing guide helps you verify that the job broadcasting system is working correctly and efficiently.
